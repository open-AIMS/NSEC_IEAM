This repository contains code to replicate the materials for Fisher, R., Fox, D.R., Negri, A.P., van Dam, J., Flores, F. and Koppel, D. (2023), Methods for estimating no-effect toxicity concentrations in ecotoxicology. Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management.  https://doi.org/10.1002/ieam.4809 

Note that to run the code you need to first download the .RData files as these are too large to store on github. These can be accessed from the AIMS metadata site at http://tsv-apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/49a297f2-48f5-4770-bccf-a21be78ec813.

The paper uses methods described in Fisher R, Fox DR. 2023. Introducing the no significant effect concentration (NSEC). Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. doi.org/10.1002/etc.5610 (code at https://github.com/open-AIMS/NSEC_ETandC). 

Bayesian model fits are achieved using the R package jagsNEC https://github.com/open-AIMS/NEC-estimation.
